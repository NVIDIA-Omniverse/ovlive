# `mixed_delta.oodf` capture metadata

**Scenario**: `mixed_delta` (synthetic — see the notes below)

- **Origin**: `oodf_ffi::build_delta` via `cargo run -p oodf-ffi --example generate_fixtures` (NOT captured from the real C++ service)
- **RPC**: N/A (synthesized; not captured from a live RPC)
- **Client config**:
  - Generator: `oodf-ffi/examples/generate_fixtures.rs`
  - StructCommands: CreateSection + MoveSection + ReorderChildren + DiffDeleteSection
  - SetFields: 2 (inline 'name'=b'hello'; external 'mesh' ext_size=65536)
  - TimeSamples: 1 (time=1.25)
- **Server version**: N/A (synthesized)
- **Capture date**: 2026-04-16 (generator run)
- **Byte length**: 552

## Semantic summary

See the table in `README.md` for the full per-fixture summary.

## Regenerating

Regenerate the synthetic file byte-for-byte:

```sh
cargo run -p oodf-ffi --example generate_fixtures
```

No recorded capture from the C++ reference service replaces this fixture;
the notes below say why the synthetic file is kept.

## Notes

Dense coverage across variants in a single delta; `is_diff=true, base_version=7, source_format=usdc`. Not a shape the real C++ service would emit on a catch-up (it reconstructs from stored state, and a diff carries only `DiffChangeSection` / `DiffDeleteSection`). Synthetic retained for branch coverage.

## Real C++ verification

- **Date**: 2026-04-17
- **Path**: CreateLayer on a fresh per-fixture layer, a deployed C++ reference service
- **Status**: `rejected`
- **OODF bytes**: 552 (OMPF-wrapped: 568)
- **gRPC code**: `INTERNAL`
- **gRPC detail**: `Failed to overwrite object`
- **Meaning**: the C++ reference service's `CreateLayer` rejected this delta (see [`CAPTURE.md`](./CAPTURE.md) §3). The fixture's builder+parser round-trip is still validated by `oodf-ffi/tests/wire_fixtures.rs`.
